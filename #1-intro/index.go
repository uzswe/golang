/*
* This GO program prints the message "Hello, World" to the terminal.
* This program is a basic example for beginners.
*
* Basic steps:
* 1. Define the main package with `package main`.
* 2. Call the formatting library with `import "fmt"`.
* 3. Create the `func main()` function â€” the starting point of GO programs.
* 4. Print text to the terminal with `fmt.Printf()`.
*
* We used fmt in this program because fmt is a special package for input/output operations.
* Actually this program is very simple, you can try to make this program yourself.
*
* Find answers to specific questions about the program:
* 1. Why are we calling and using the main package in this program?
* 2. Can we change the main function name to myMain?
*
