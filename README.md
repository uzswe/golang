# Guide to the Project

Hello, This project is for absolute beginners who want to learn the GO programming language from scratch. With this project, you can learn the GO programming language from basic concepts to advanced topics.

### About GO programming lanuage

Go, also called Golang or Go language, is an Open Source programming language that Google developed. Software developers use Go in an array of operating systems and frameworks to develop web applications, cloud and networking services, and other types of software.

Go is statically typed, explicit and modeled after the C programming language. Because of Go language's fast startup time, low runtime overhead and ability to run without a virtual machine (VM), it has become a very popular language for writing microservices and other uses. In addition, Go is used for concurrent programming -- a strategy to execute multiple tasks at one time, out of order or in partial order.

Go language was inspired by the productivity and relative simplicity of Python. It uses goroutines, or lightweight processes, and a collection of packages for efficient dependency management. It was designed to solve several problems, including slow build time, uncontrolled dependencies, effort duplication, difficulty writing automatic tools and cross-language development.

### About This Project

This project will teach you:

- Learning the basics of GO programming, including syntax, variables, loops, and functions.
- Understanding more advanced concepts like concurrency, interfaces, and working with databases.
- You can gain practical experience through practical exercises and real examples.

### Learning Structure

Each topic is organized into separate folders, making it easy to follow and practice. Every section includes:

- **Theoretical explanations** to understand the concepts.
- **Short exercises** to reinforce learning.
- **Code examples** to demonstrate real-world applications.

### Who Is This For?

- Beginners who have never coded before.
- Developers looking to learn GO from scratch.
- Anyone interested in building efficient and scalable applications with GO.
